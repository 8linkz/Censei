- Automatic host availability checking
- Intelligent crawling of directory indexes
- Recursive directory scanning with configurable depth
- Flexible filtering by file extensions
- Parallel processing for higher speed
- Smart host blocking with persistent blocklist
- Performance limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Detailed outputs (raw and filtered)
- Configurable logging
- Interactive and automated modes
- Special verification mode for binary files without HTML processing
- File content verification for binary detection
- Target-specific file search functionality

### Use Cases

- Security research
- Identification of exposed files
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Security audits
- Automated scanning processes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- **Censys subscription** for API access (important: This tool does not work without a valid Censys subscription and API credentials!)
- **For Platform API v3 mode (default):** Censys API credentials (API ID and Secret)
- **For Legacy mode (optional):** Censys CLI ([Installation via pip](https://github.com/censys/censys-command-line))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/8linkz/censei.git
   cd censei
   ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

3. (Optional) Install Censys CLI for legacy mode:
   ```bash
   pip install censys-command-line
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ./censei --help
   ```

### Setting up configuration files

Censei supports two API modes:

- **Platform API v3 (default):** Uses the modern Censys Platform API with bearer token authentication
- **Legacy mode:** Uses the older Censys CLI tool (activated with `--legacy` flag)

Create the configuration files:

1. **config.json** - Basic settings:
   ```json
   {
     "api_key": "your-censys-api-key",
     "api_secret": "your-censys-api-secret",
     "bearer_token": "your-platform-api-bearer-token",
     "organization_id": "",
     "v3_max_results": 500,
     "legacy_pages": 25,
     "legacy_per_page": 100,
     "legacy_index_type": "hosts",
     "legacy_sort_order": "DESCENDING",
     "legacy_virtual_hosts": "INCLUDE",
     "queries_file_v3": "./queriesv3.json",
     "queries_file_legacy": "./legacy_queries.json",
     "output_dir": "./output",
     "binary_output_file": "./output/binary_found.txt",
     "http_timeout_seconds": 5,
     "max_concurrent_requests": 10,
     "log_level": "INFO",
     "log_file": "./censei.log",
     "max_links_per_directory": 500,
     "max_total_links": 10000,
     "max_skips_before_block": 5,
     "enable_blocklist": false,
     "blocklist_file": "./blocklist.txt"
   }
   ```

   > **Note**: The `queries_file_v3` and `queries_file_legacy` fields are optional. If not specified, they default to `./queriesv3.json` and `./legacy_queries.json` respectively. Adjust these paths to match your directory structure.

2. **queriesv3.json** (for Platform API v3 mode) OR **legacy_queries.json** (for legacy mode) - Predefined queries:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "Russia Suspicious OpenDir",
       "query": "labels:suspicious-open-dir and location.country_code:RU",
       "recursive": "yes",
       "max-depth": 3,
       "filters": [".pdf", ".lnk", ".exe", ".elf"]
     },
     {
       "name": "US OpenDir",
       "query": "labels:open-dir and location.country_code:US",
       "recursive": "yes",
       "max-depth": 3,
       "filters": [".docx", ".zip", ".xlsx"]
     },
     {
       "name": "Cobalt Strike Scanner",
       "query": "services.labels:`open-dir` and services.labels:`c2`",
       "filters": [],
       "check": true,
       "target_filename": "02.08.2022.exe"
     }
   ]
   ```

> **IMPORTANT**:
> - For **Platform API v3 mode (default)**: Use `queriesv3.json` and provide API credentials in config.json
> - For **Legacy mode**: Use `legacy_queries.json`, install Censys CLI, and use the `--legacy` flag
> - Visit [https://censys.io/plans](https://censys.io/plans) for subscription information

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Start Censei in interactive mode:

```bash
./censei
```

### Examples for different scenarios

**Direct query with specific filters:**
```bash
./censei --query="labels:suspicious-open-dir and location.country_code:RU" --filter=".pdf,.exe"
```

**Recursive scanning with depth limit:**
```bash
./censei --recursive --max-depth=3 --query="labels:open-dir and location.country_code:US"
```

**Query with custom output path:**
```bash
./censei --output=/path/to/results
```

**Query with different log level:**
```bash
./censei --log-level=DEBUG
```

**Using alternative configuration files:**
```bash
./censei --config=/path/to/config.json --queries=/path/to/queries.json
```

**Using legacy mode with Censys CLI:**
```bash
./censei --legacy --queries=legacy_queries.json
```

**Enabling File Checker mode:**
```bash
./censei --check --target-file="suspicious.exe"
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--config` | Path to configuration file | `./config.json` |
| `--queries` | Path to queries file | `./queriesv3.json` (or `./legacy_queries.json` in legacy mode) |
| `--query` | Direct execution of a specific query | - |
| `--filter` | Specification of file extensions to filter (comma-separated) | - |
| `--output` | Override output directory | From configuration |
| `--log-level` | Set log level (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) | From configuration |
| `--legacy` | Use legacy Censys CLI mode instead of Platform API v3 | `false` |
| `--check` | Enables the File Checker mode - checks hosts for specific binary files (still processes directories if target not found) | `false` |
| `--target-file` | Specifies the specific file to search for in File Checker mode | - |
| `--recursive` | Enable recursive directory scanning | `false` |
| `--max-depth` | Maximum depth for recursive scanning (requires --recursive) | `1` |

### Interactive Mode vs. Direct Queries

When the tool is started without the `--query` parameter, Censei starts in interactive mode and presents a menu with predefined queries from your queries.json file. This mode is user-friendly and ideal for exploration.

**Interactive Menu Features:**
- Displays up to 25 queries per page with pagination
- Shows query details (filters, recursive settings, target files)
- Navigation commands:
  - `[1-N]` - Select a query by number
  - `[c]` - Enter a custom query
  - `[n]` - Next page (if more queries available)
  - `[p]` - Previous page (if on page 2+)

For automation or scripts, use the `--query` parameter to execute a specific query directly without user interaction.

## Output Files

Censei generates three main output files in the configured output directory:

### raw.txt

Contains all discovered URLs and files, formatted as:

```
http://example.com
Found file: http://example.com/index.html
Found file: http://example.com/data/
Found file: http://example.com/backup.zip
```

With File Checker mode enabled, binary files found will be displayed as:

```
http://example.com
Found binary file: http://example.com/02.08.2022.exe with Content-Type: application/x-msdownload
```

### filtered.txt

Contains only files that match the filter criteria:

```
http://example.com/backup.zip
http://example.com/documents/secret.pdf
```

### binary_found.txt

Contains paths to binary files identified during scanning:

```
http://example.com/02.08.2022.exe with Content-Type: application/x-msdownload
http://example.com/tools/app.exe with Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```

At the end of the raw.txt file, a summary of the scan with statistics and configuration details is appended.

## Advanced Features

### Recursive Directory Scanning

Censei supports recursive directory scanning to automatically explore subdirectories:

- **Enable recursion**: Set `"recursive": "yes"` in queries.json or use `--recursive` flag
- **Control depth**: Configure `"max-depth": 3` or use `--max-depth=3` to limit scanning depth
- **Performance protection**: Built-in limits prevent infinite recursion and resource exhaustion

### Smart Host Blocking

The tool includes intelligent host management to improve scanning efficiency:

- **Automatic blocking**: Hosts exceeding limits are automatically blocked
- **Persistent blocklist**: Blocked hosts are saved to file and persist between sessions
- **Configurable thresholds**: Adjust `max_skips_before_block` to control blocking sensitivity
- **Performance optimization**: Prevents wasting time on problematic hosts

### Performance Limits

Built-in safeguards prevent resource exhaustion:

- **Per-directory limits**: `max_links_per_directory` controls links processed per directory
- **Total link limits**: `max_total_links` sets overall limit per host
- **Memory protection**: Prevents excessive memory usage during large directory scans

### File Checker Mode

The File Checker mode is a special operating mode optimized for targeted searching for binary files:

- Activated by `check: true` in queries.json or `--check` on the command line
- When a `target_filename` is specified, checks hosts for that specific file first
- If the target file is found, skips further HTML processing for that host
- If the target file is NOT found, continues with normal directory scanning
- Uses GET requests with partial reads (512 bytes) to determine file type
- Does not save files to disk
- Optimized for quick identification of potentially harmful binary files

This mode is especially useful for security analysts looking for specific binary files without having to search through entire directory contents.

### Binary File Detection

Censei can detect binary files based on their Content-Type headers, including:
- **Generic binary**: application/octet-stream, application/binary
- **Executables**: application/x-executable, application/x-msdownload, application/exe, application/x-dosexec
- **Archives (ZIP)**: application/zip, application/x-zip-compressed
- **Archives (RAR, 7Z, TAR, GZ)**: application/x-rar, application/x-7z-compressed, application/x-tar, application/gzip
- **Scripts**: application/x-sh, application/x-bat

**Detection Methods:**
- **General file checking**: Uses HEAD requests to check Content-Type headers without downloading files
- **Targeted file checking** (with `--target-file`): Uses GET requests with partial reads (512 bytes) to verify file type and content

### Customizing Filters

You can customize filters in three ways:

1. In the queries.json file for predefined queries
2. With the `--filter` option on the command line
3. In interactive mode when selecting "Custom query"

The filter format is a comma-separated list of file extensions (e.g. `.pdf,.exe,.zip`).

### Customizing Log Levels

Available log levels:

- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for troubleshooting
- `INFO`: General operational information
- `ERROR`: Error messages only

Set the log level in config.json or with the `--log-level` parameter.

### Optimizing Parallelization

Adjust the `max_concurrent_requests` setting in config.json based on your system capabilities and network conditions. Higher values increase performance but may lead to rate limiting or resource exhaustion.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

**Censys CLI not found:**
```
ERROR: The censys-cli tool was not found. Please install it with:
pip install censys-command-line
```
Solution: Install the Censys CLI as indicated.

**API credentials invalid:**
```
Failed to execute Censys query: censys CLI error: Invalid API ID or Secret
```
Solution: Check your API credentials in config.json.

**No results found:**
```
Extracted 0 hosts from Censys results
```
Solution: Check your query string or try a broader search.

### Debugging Tips

1. Set the log level to DEBUG for detailed information:
   ```bash
   ./censei --log-level=DEBUG
   ```

2. Check the generated JSON file to ensure Censys is returning results:
   ```bash
   cat output/censys_results.json
   ```

3. Test the Censys CLI manually to verify API functionality:
   ```bash
   censys search "labels:open-dir" --output test.json
   ```
